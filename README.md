## Introduction

This repository showcases my final submission project for the Python and Machine Learning Bootcamp conducted by Devtown. The project aims to demonstrate my understanding of Python programming and machine learning concepts by implementing a specific task or application.

## Bootcamp Description

The Python and Machine Learning Bootcamp conducted by Devtown was an intensive learning program that covered a wide range of topics related to Python programming and machine learning. The bootcamp provided training and practical examples to enhance participants' skills in these areas.

## Project Description

This project contains that a project explores the relationship between sales and advertising using linear regression. The project analyzes a dataset stored in the file "Sales.txt," which consists of 36 data points with two columns: "Sales" and "Advertising."

## Result

The project provides insights into the relationship between sales and advertising, utilizing linear regression to predict advertising values based on sales data. The scatter plot visualizes this relationship, and the model's predictions are displayed alongside the original data. The results can be used to gain insights into the effectiveness of advertising in driving sales and inform future marketing strategies.
